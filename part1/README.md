# Part 1

In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the **React** library, which we will be using to write the code that runs in the browser. We will also look at some features of Javascript that are important for understanding React.

## Requirements
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)


## Start an application

There is one application by folder. To start an application :

```bash
# Head to the desired exercise (courseinfo, unicafe or anecdotes)
$ cd courseinfo
# Install the dependencies
$ npm i
# Start the application
$ npm run dev
```

You can then access the frontend on [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) if you have followed along properly.
