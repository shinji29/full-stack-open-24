# Part 2

In this part, we will first take a look at how to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen. 

After this, we will inspect how a user can submit data to a React application using **HTML forms**. 

Next, our focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote **backend server**.

Lastly, we will take a quick look at a few simple ways of adding **CSS styles** to our React applications.

## Requirements
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)


## Start an application

There is one application by folder. To start an application :

```bash
# Head to the desired exercise (courseinfo, unicafe or anecdotes)
$ cd countries
# Install the dependencies
$ npm i
# Start the application
$ npm run dev
```

You can then access the frontend on [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) if you have followed along properly.
